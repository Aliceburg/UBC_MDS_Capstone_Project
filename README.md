## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset we used in this project is the Rural Canada Business Profiles(RCBP). It is a brand new database, which was first published by Statistics Canada on March 11, 2022. Now the available time period is from 2017 to 2019. RCBP provides financial profiles for Small and Medium Businesses(SMB) in rural and urban Canada, wherein the small businesses are the businesses with total annual revenues of $30,000 to $5,000,000, and the medium businesses are the businesses with total annual revenues of $5,000,001 to $20,000,000.

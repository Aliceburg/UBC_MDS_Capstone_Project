1,"To ensure respondent confidentiality, estimates below a certain threshold are suppressed. For Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia suppression is applied to all data below 1,500. The threshold level for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 500, while in Prince Edward Island, estimates under 200 are supressed. For census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and economic regions (ERs), use their respective provincial suppression levels mentioned above. Estimates are based on smaller sample sizes the more detailed the table becomes, which could result in lower data quality.",,,,,,,,,,,
2,"On February 9, 2021, the data for 2006 to 2010 were removed from this table.",,,,,,,,,,,
3,Excluding the territories.,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"Number of persons who, during the reference week, worked for pay or profit, or performed unpaid family work or had a job but were not at work due to own illness or disability, personal or family responsibilities, labour dispute, vacation, or other reason. Those persons on layoff and persons without work but who had a job to start at a definite date in the future are not considered employed. Estimates in thousands, rounded to the nearest hundred.",,,,,,,,,,,
11,"The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed persons expressed as a percentage of the labour force. The unemployment rate for a particular group (age, sex, marital status, etc.) is the number unemployed in that group expressed as a percentage of the labour force for that group. Estimates are percentages, rounded to the nearest tenth.",,,,,,,,,,,
5,"Are large population centres (known as cores) together with adjacent fringe and rural areas that have a high degree of social and economic integration with the cores. A CMA (census metropolitan area) has a population of at least 100,000 and a CA (census agglomeration) has a population of at least 10,000 based on the previous census.",,,,,,,,,,,
6,"The core is the population centre with the highest population, around which a census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is delineated. The core must have a population of at least 50,000 persons in the case of a CMA, or at least 10,000 persons in the case of a CA based on the previous census. This category also includes the secondary core, which is comprised of a population centre within a CMA that has at least 10,000 persons and was the core of a CA that has been merged with an adjacent CMA.",,,,,,,,,,,
7,"The fringe includes all population centres within a census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) that have less than 10,000 persons, based on the previous census population counts, and are not contiguous with the core or secondary core.",,,,,,,,,,,
8,"Rural areas are sparsely populated lands which include small towns, villages and other populated places with less than 1,000 population according to the previous census, as well as remote areas and agricultural lands. Rural areas can be found inside or outside of census metropolitan areas (CMA) or census agglomerations (CA).",,,,,,,,,,,
9,Non-census metropolitan area or census agglomeration (Non-CMA/CA) are all areas outside of the metropolitan/agglomeration area.,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"A small population centre is an area outside a census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA). Small population centres have populations between 1,000 to 10,000 based on the previous census population counts.",,,,,,,,,,,
